title: "Identifying Genes near DMRs"
output: html_document

In this Rmarkdown file we will take a methylKit output file and end up with a list of genes associated with the DMRs based on genomic location. 


## Getting Setup
We will be using the Project feature in Rstudio where you will have access to data files in a manner that relative paths can be used. Files being provided to you (results of other processes) are in the `data` directory. You likely have the package dplyr installed on your machine. If for some reason you do not you woul need to run the following chunk after removing `#`.

```{r, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("tidyr")
```


Once the library is instaled, you need to load the libary
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```


# Step  1. PREPARING A BED FILE

Here we read in the methylKit output file containing DMRs between sperm and RBCs in _O. mykiss_

```{r}
DMRoutput <- read.csv ("../data/SpvRBC_DMR100bp_75percdiff")
knitr::kable(
  DMRoutput[1:5, ]
)
```



Filtering DMRs to return only those that are _hypo-methylated_ (in sperm v. RBC) and saving this as `DMRoutput_hypo`

```{r}
DMRoutput_hypo <- filter(DMRoutput, meth.diff < 0)
knitr::kable(
  DMRoutput_hypo[1:5, ]
)
```


Reformatting the output into a bed file (fields: chrom, chromStart,chromEnd,name*)

The name field can contain any information that you want to keep with the region, we will retain the meth.diff column. 




```{r}
DMRoutput_hypo.bed <- select(DMRoutput_hypo,chr,start,end,meth.diff)  
knitr::kable(
  DMRoutput_hypo.bed[1:5, ]
)
```

Write the table to the `analyses` directory.

```{r}
write.table (DMRoutput_hypo.bed,"../analyses/DMRs_hypo.bed",col.names = F, sep = '\t', row.names = F,quote = F)
```


# STEP 2. USING GENOMIC ARITHMATIC TO ANNOTATE REGIONS OF INTEREST

**IMPORTANT** You will need to do is revise the two chunks below to include the locations of bedtools on your computer. If bedtools is in your system path simply `bedtools` would work.

First we will sort the file created in prior Step.

```{bash}
/Applications/bioinfo/bedtools2/bin/bedtools \
sort \
-i ../analyses/DMRs_hypo.bed \
> ../analyses/DMRs_hypo.sorted.bed
```


Then find closest genes with -D arguement reporting distance from genes

```{bash}
/Applications/bioinfo/bedtools2/bin/bedtools \
closest \
-a ../analyses/DMRs_hypo.sorted.bed \
-b ../data/Omy_mRNA_subset.gff \
-D b \
> ../analyses/closetgene.txt

head -3 ../analyses/closetgene.txt
```




# STEP 3. JOINING TABLES AND FILTERING BASED ON DISTANCE AND QUALIY OF ANNOTATION

Reading in table from Step 2 into R. At the same time we will rename the columns to something more meaningful.

```{r}
DMRwgene <- read.table("../analyses/closetgene.txt", sep = '\t') %>% 
  rename( DMR_chr= V1, DMR_start = V2, DMR_end = V3, DMR_meth.diff = V4,
                     gene_seqname = V5, gene_source = V6, DMR_feature = V7, gene_start = V8,
                     gene_end = V9, gene_score= V10, gene_strand = V11, DMR_frame = V12,
                     gene_attribute = V13, dist_bp = V14)

knitr::kable(
  DMRwgene[1:2, ]
)
```
Reading in blast output from comparing _O. mykiss_ to Swiss-Prot

```{r}
genes_annot <- read.table("../data/Omy_BLAST_UniProt.tab", header=T, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors=F, fill=T, quote="", na.strings="", comment.char="")


knitr::kable(
  genes_annot[1:2, ]
)
```



Performing a left join to join the output of bedtools (DMRwgene) to the blast output (genes_annot)

```{r}
DMRwAnnot <- left_join(DMRwgene,genes_annot, by = c("gene_attribute" = "Sequence"))

```




```{r}
head(DMRwAnnot)

```

Now we will filter the annotations to, 1) genes within 10kb of DMR, 2) and e-value of < 1e-10. And separated the blast Hit.Name so accession number and entry name are in new columns


```{r}
DMRwAnnot.filtered <- DMRwAnnot %>% 
filter(dist_bp <= abs(10000) & E.Value <= 1e-10)  %>% 
separate(Hit.Name, into = c("db", "acc", "entry_name"), sep = "\\|") 
head(DMRwAnnot.filtered)  
```     




Saving files 

```{r}
write.table(DMRwAnnot.filtered,"../analyses/DMR_fullannotations.txt",sep = "\t",quote = F,row.names = F)


write.table(DMRwAnnot.filtered$entry_name, "../analyses/DMR_Entry_Name.txt", sep = "\t", quote = F, row.names = F, col.names = F)
```
